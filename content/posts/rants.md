- I can't stand when people:
  - Are mean and disrespectful to animals.
  - Judge others by the way they look.
  - Behave differently towards others but not you.
  - Expect you to follow their ideas.
  - Talk to you as if you live under a rock.
  - Hide there problems instead of talking about it, pretending all is well.

- Also:
  - Being in a shop, and having to endure their stupid music.
