If you're curious, this website is where I occasionally share my thoughts and ideas publicly. I prefer to post here, where I have full control, rather than relying on other platforms. This way, I can express myself freely without worrying about censorship algorithms.

No bullshit cookies, ads or tracking found here.

This site is hosted in Belgium ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª (the server is on my desk) and runs on FreeBSD.
